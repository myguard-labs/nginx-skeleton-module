# sync-stamp.sh -- content-hash stamp for the CI files an adopter copies.
#
# THE PROBLEM. This repo is the reference: labs/nginx-*-module trees copy its
# .github/ tree and then edit it locally. Neither side has a cheap way to answer
# "is that copy of build-test.yml still the one the skeleton ships, or did the
# adopter edit it / did the skeleton move?" -- short of diffing every file by
# hand. The stamps make that a sha comparison: `--list` on both repos, diff the
# two outputs, and every drifted file names itself.
#
# WHY A HASH, NOT A TIMESTAMP. A `# updated: 2026-08-04` header answers "when
# did someone touch this", which is not the question. It moves on no-op
# reformats, it does NOT move when a file is edited without discipline, and two
# repos with identical content can carry different dates -- so a human still has
# to diff to find out. A content hash answers the actual question, mechanically:
# equal sha means equal content, no judgement involved. It is the same reasoning
# .github/versions.env already applies to tarballs, and install-linters.sh to
# the actionlint binary: pin the CONTENT, not a label describing it.
#
# THE SELF-REFERENCE. A hash of a file cannot live in that file -- writing it
# changes the content it describes. So the stamp line itself is EXCLUDED from
# the digest: the hash covers the file with its `# sync-sha:` line removed. That
# makes it stable across re-stamping and lets `--check` recompute it in place.
#
# Usage:
#   ci/tools/sync-stamp.sh            # rewrite every stamp (use after editing)
#   ci/tools/sync-stamp.sh --check    # verify; exit 1 on any stale/missing stamp
#   ci/tools/sync-stamp.sh --list     # print path<TAB>sha, for an adopting repo
#
# --check is what CI runs: it fails when a tracked file was edited without
# re-stamping, so the stamps cannot rot into decoration.
#
# SCOPE: the files actually shared with an adopter -- workflows, the scripts
# they call, and composite actions. ci/linter/ and ci/tools/ are NOT stamped;
# they are a much wider surface that rename-module.sh rewrites with the
# adopting module's own name, paths and thresholds, so they drift from the
# skeleton by design and a stamp on them would report drift that is the
# intended state.

# Insert the stamp as a LONE line, adding no blank line of its own.

# The blank line matters more than it looks. content_sha() strips only the

# content and changes the very digest just recorded -- every file then reads
# STALE the instant after it was stamped. (Observed: the first version printed
# a trailing "" and all 14 files failed --check immediately.) So: insert one
# line, remove one line, and the operation is exactly invertible.
#
# Placement: after a shebang if there is one (it must stay line 1), otherwise
# at the very top. Not "after the leading comment block" -- .github/workflows
# files start with `name:` and their comments come after it, so there is no
# single header shape to aim for, and the top is unambiguous for a reader
# looking to compare two repos' copies.
# Any existing stamp is dropped in the same awk pass, so re-stamping cannot
# accumulate lines and the strip filter is expressed in exactly one place.
