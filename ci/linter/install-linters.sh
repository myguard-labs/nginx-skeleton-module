#!/usr/bin/env bash
# ci/linter/install-linters.sh -- install every linter ci/linter/ needs.
#
# Order of preference, per tool: apt-get (distro-managed, no PEP 668 fight)
# -> pipx/pip (Python tools apt does not carry) -> cpan (Perl modules apt does
# not carry) -> upstream binary (actionlint). Nothing here is a silent skip:
# a tool that fails to install prints why and the script exits non-zero, so a
# half-installed toolchain cannot masquerade as a working gate.
#
# Usage:
#   ci/linter/install-linters.sh            install what is missing
#   ci/linter/install-linters.sh --check    report only, install nothing
#   ci/linter/install-linters.sh --force    reinstall even if present
#
# Needs sudo for the apt-get and cpan steps; the pipx step installs into
# ~/.local/bin (make sure it is on PATH).
#
# Side effects: apt-get install, pipx install, cpanm install, and one curl of
# the actionlint release tarball into /usr/local/bin.
#
# Extend: add a line to the APT/PIPX/CPAN lists. Anything needing a bespoke
# install gets its own function at the bottom, next to install_actionlint.
