# ci/linter/lint-python.sh -- ruff lint + format check over tracked *.py.
#
# ruff replaces flake8/pyflakes/isort/black here: one binary, no venv, and it
# is what the superrepo's tools/ scripts are already checked with. The module
# tree carries no Python today; this gate exists so the first helper script
# committed under ci/tools/ is checked from its first commit instead of after
# it has grown.
#
# `ruff format --check` reports formatting WITHOUT rewriting: a linter that
# edits files behind a commit hook changes what you are about to commit.
#
# Usage: ci/linter/lint-python.sh [files...]   Env: LINT_MODE=staged|all
# Extend: per-rule config goes in a [tool.ruff] block in pyproject.toml at the
# repo root, not in flags here, so editors and CI see the same rules.

# shellcheck source=ci/linter/lib.sh
