    ci/linter/workflow_policy.py docs        README <-> workflows drift

Each subcommand is wrapped by a ci/linter/lint-*.sh so run-all.sh picks it up by
glob and a human can select it with LINT_ONLY. Exit: 0 clean, 1 findings,
2 could not run.

WHY THESE ARE NOT actionlint OR zizmor RULES. Both of those read a workflow
against GENERAL knowledge -- syntax, and a catalogue of known attack shapes.
The three checks here encode facts about THIS repo that no general tool can
know: which self-hosted labels exist, that the runners are persistent and
shared with package builds, which port band each job owns, and which files
document the pipeline. They are the checks that go red when a NEW workflow is
added without the property every existing one happens to have -- the case where
copying an existing file is the only thing standing between the repo and a
regression, and nothing enforces the copy.
