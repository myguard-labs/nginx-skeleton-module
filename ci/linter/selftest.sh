# ci/linter/selftest.sh -- negative controls for the lint gate itself.
#
# The gate is the thing that decides whether everything else is allowed to
# land, so "the gate ran and said clean" has to be distinguishable from "the
# gate ran nothing and said clean". That distinction is not observable from a
# green lint job: a selector typo used to make run-all.sh print
# "== all linters clean ==" and exit 0 having executed zero checkers.
#
# Every case here asserts the FAILING direction -- a check that only ever
# asserts the passing direction cannot detect its own disarming.
#
# Usage:  ci/linter/selftest.sh
# Exit:   0 all controls held, 1 one or more did not.
#
# Runs in about a second: no case invokes a real checker (LINT_ONLY values are
# either bogus or rejected before dispatch), so no linter needs to be installed.
#
# Extend: add a case() line. Keep each case asserting a specific exit status,
# and prefer a case where the OLD, broken behaviour would have passed.
