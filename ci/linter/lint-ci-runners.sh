# ci/linter/lint-ci-runners.sh -- fork PRs must never select the self-hosted
# runners.
#
# The rule and the reasoning live in ci/linter/workflow_policy.py (subcommand
# `runners`); this wrapper exists so run-all.sh picks the check up by glob and
# LINT_ONLY=ci-runners selects it, like every other checker here.
#
# Why it is a GATE and not advice: the self-hosted runners are persistent and shared
# with the Debian package builds. A pull_request-triggered job executes scripts
# from the PR head, so one workflow missing the fork fallback hands an arbitrary
# contributor code execution on the build host. This is a public template repo;
# taking outside contributions is the point.
#
# Usage: ci/linter/lint-ci-runners.sh [files...]   Env: LINT_MODE=staged|all
# Extend: approved runner selectors are the TRUST_SPLITS set in workflow_policy.py.

# shellcheck source=ci/linter/lib.sh

# The check is whole-tree by nature -- a runner policy is a property of the SET
# of workflows, not of one file -- so the file list above is only used to decide
# whether this checker is RELEVANT to the change, never to narrow what it reads.
